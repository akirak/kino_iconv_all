# Kino.IconvAll.Git

This is a [Kino](https://github.com/livebook-dev/kino)-based user interface for
[Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) that lets you configure and perform conversion
of character encoding using iconv. It is a wrapper around
[iconv_all](https://github.com/akirak/iconv_all), which converts all files
matching a glob pattern in a Git repository. It is intended for helping with
interactive analysis of code base in a legacy encoding.
